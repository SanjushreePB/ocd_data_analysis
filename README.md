# ocd_data_analysis
# worked with various data analysis tools, including SQL, Power BI, and Excel, to derive insights from a dataset on OCD patients that includes both demographics and clinical data.
#SQL helped me manipulate the data and perform some feature engineering. 
#Excel and Power BI assisted me in visualizing my findings in a way that was easy for stakeholders to consume.
