# ocd_data_analysis

#I worked with various data analysis tools, including SQL and Power BI  to derive insights from a dataset on OCD patients that includes both demographics and clinical data. 
#SQL helped me manipulate the data and perform some feature engineering. 
# Power BI is used in visualizing my findings in a way that is easy for stakeholders to consume.
